# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Todo: 
create content for your headlines using chatGPT
add transform effects to when hovering the icons, and also the About,Experience, Technologies

Decorate the position section
Have some effects when hovering the name and the headlines

Maybe use conditional rendering to have the right side scrolling or disappear and appear depending on the effect

make it clean like https://brittanychiang.com/

have the flashlight highlighting gradient thing when the mouse move as well

change the vite logo and the tag line as well
